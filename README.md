## About the Project
This project enables a user to enter an infinite number of integers, then prints out some information regarding those inputs.  This program prompts the user to enter in as many numbers as he/she wants, until the user inputs a zero.  To do this, a loop is needed; this loop runs until the sentinel value is entered.  Afterwards, some statistics of the user's inputs is displayed.

The objective of this program is to demonstrate the following: 
* practice writing a short Python program
* utilize conditional statements and a loop to accomplish a task
* further display knowledge of basic Python arithmetic

This program assumes that the user will enter a valid input each time the program requests an integer value.  The program's output will result in unknown behavior if anything other than an integer is entered by the user.  

## Getting Started
To run the program, download the contents of the project and simply run make in the terminal.
